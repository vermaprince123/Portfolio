# Profile Photo Setup Instructions

## Where to Place Your Photo

1. **Save your profile photo** as `profile-photo.png` in the `/public` folder:

   ```
   Portfolio/public/profile-photo.png
   ```

2. **Recommended Image Specifications:**
   - Format: PNG (with transparent background preferred) or JPG
   - Size: At least 400x400 pixels (square image works best)
   - Aspect Ratio: 1:1 (square) for best results
   - File Size: Optimize to under 500KB for faster loading

## Favicon Setup

The profile photo is also used as the favicon. For best results:

1. **Create favicon files** (optional but recommended):

   - `favicon.ico` - 16x16, 32x32, 48x48 sizes
   - `apple-touch-icon.png` - 180x180 pixels
   - You can use online tools like https://realfavicongenerator.net/ to generate these from your profile photo

2. **Or simply use the profile photo** - The current setup uses `/profile-photo.png` as the favicon, which will work but may not be optimized for all browsers.

## Current Usage

Your profile photo is used in:

- ✅ **Favicon** - Browser tab icon
- ✅ **Hero Section** - Large profile photo at the top
- ✅ **About Section** - Profile photo in the about card
- ✅ **Open Graph** - Social media preview images

## Image Optimization Tips

For best performance:

- Use a tool like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to compress the image
- Ensure the image is square (1:1 aspect ratio)
- Crop to focus on your face for the best appearance in circular frames
